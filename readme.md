The written analysis has the following:

Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to provide data to investors in support of the proposal that a bike-sharing program in
Des Moines is a good idea. 

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

Perhaps the most striking thing about the analysis is that the bike sharing program was used mostly for commuting to work.
Most use was during typical work commute times and on the weekdays.
We might infer that this means it would be less effected by trends in recreation. It may also point to another demographic
that we may try to gain. 
Additionally, most users were men. The reason for the difference isn't immediatly clear. 
Most users were subscribers, which would seem to bode well for long term business, rather than relying on people that take a
one off bike ride. 
We might consider several drawbacks to our data. Des Moines
