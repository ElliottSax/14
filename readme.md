Overview of the statistical analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to provide data to investors in support of the proposal that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a good idea.

Most users of the bike-sharing program are subscribers. Few users as a percentage are one off users. 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElliottSax/14/main/Weekdayperhour.PNG">
Most users use the service during typical work commute times. Bicycles may be their main form of transportation. There is also a fair amount on Saturdays.
Perhaps the bicycles provide value as a solution for traffic congestion or are simply less costly than cars or public transportation.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElliottSax/14/main/GenderBreakdown.PNG">
Men are the largest user group for the bike-sharing program.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElliottSax/14/main/CheckoutGender.PNG">
Checkout durations peak strongly for men. Female is more evenly distributed. Unknown genders are more flatly distributed.

Trip duration is strongly concentrated at a length of around 10 minutes.

Starting and ending locations for trips are nearly identical.
     
High-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations

Perhaps the most striking thing about the analysis is that the bike sharing program was used mostly for commuting to work.
Most use was during typical work commute times and on the weekdays.
We might infer that this means it would be less effected by trends in recreation. It may also point to another demographic
that we may try to gain. 
Additionally, most users were men. The reason for the difference isn't immediatly clear. 
Most users were subscribers, which would seem to bode well for long term business, rather than relying on people that take a
one off bike ride. 
We might consider several drawbacks to our data. Des Moines has a different climate than New York. Des Moines winters are more severe.
We might also see New York as trendy, perhaps Des Moines is less likely to adopt the bicyle trend. Perhaps most of all, with covid
what does the latest data look like with signifigantly less people commuting to work. We could focus our analysis on the optimal
areas for the program and scale it accordingly. It may be a good idea to create a heat map of optimal areas for the program. 
Similiarly, it may be a good idea to view optimal times of the year for the program.
More than anything, we need to look at newer data. We need to look at bicycling data specific to
Des Moines.
